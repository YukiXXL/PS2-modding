KEYBOARD NEEDED!

For Public Beta 1, "gCHEATS_ENABLED" is needed!
Cheat menu and console (in-game) are opened with tilde key on the keyboard.

Cheat codes:
INVUL - Enables invulnerability (can be toggled by typing OFF/ON in-game like "cheat invul off" to turn off)
LEVEL - I don't know what this one does
COMPLETE - this one is better used in the menus. Completes all objectives
WIN - does something when used in the menus but when used in-game, it completes the mission with par time and no deaths/collateral

Command list:
EXIT - Close Console
CLS - Clear Console Screen
VERSION - Version
FULLCONS - Fullscreen Console
HALFCONS - Halfscreen Console (DEFAULT)
