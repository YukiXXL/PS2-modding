- Intro music loops and never changes.
- When host or client is crossing the pipe, the camera angle change will occur only on host screen.
- Body for "Pick up the body" objective appears either to the host or some client. Sometimes can be seen as death box but still can be picked up.

Italy:
- Intro music loops and never changes.
- Failing objective doesn't reset the mission.
- Dmitri can be taken out early and mission can still be finished.
- If host is taken out, it resets the mission making some enemies only respawn for the host but enemies still react to clients. if enemies are taken out in the area where the host was taken out, enemies won't respawn.

- Host sees "interaction" button whenever client sees it but on clients side, it only sas "Interact" and only host sees what it should say.
- Hosts weapons reset to missions restricted ones (Shurikens).
- Clients can pick up enemy weapons. Using them doesn't break stealth but makes enemies turn to direction where weapon is fired.
- Whoever picks up the briefcase should change the outfit to give the briefcase to Sok-Ju Yang and pick it up again, otherwise game resets the objective thinking you only now picked up the briefcase.
- If host is taken out, it resets the mission making some enemies only respawn for the host but enemies still react to clients. if enemies are taken out in the area where the host was taken out, enemies won't respawn.
- If Sok-Ju Yang or Samaev were taken out, the mission is softlocked. Resetting the mission won't respawn them.

Yemen: Arms Bazaar:
- Intro music loops and never changes.
- Clients start with K-BAR while host starts with nothing.
- Stealth fails immediately.
- VIP can still be killed and credentials can be taken but guards won't take them so it still fails the objective on entering the market.
- Thae-bok Jon still spawns.
- When host or client is collecting the tape, the camera angle change will occur only on host screen.
- Destroying all communication equipments doesn't spawn Khorsh's Thugs.
- Nobody can pick up the grenades for Zohar so mission cannot be completed.

Minsk:
- Intro music loops and never changes.
- Host sees "interaction" button whenever client sees it but on clients side, it only sas "Interact" and only host sees what it should say.
- Clients spawn with every equipped weapon at the beginning (back, auxiliary).
- Guards are treated as enemies and can be targeted by clients only.
- if client holds a visible weapon, and a host is seen an enemy on the street, stealth fails as if host had the visible weapon. if host has visible weapon, enemies will attempt to shoot at clients but stealth won't fail.
- if client is in suspicious area, and a host is seen by an enemy on the street, stealth fails as if host was in suspicious area. if host is in suspicious area, enemies will attempt to shoot at clients but stealth won't fail.
- Disguise works both for client and host, no matter who wears it. the previous two things still apply.
- Enemies (on the streets AND the snipers) react on who spawned them. if host spawned them, they can be killed by either host or client WHILE the host is still present in the spawn area (as in area where enemies are spawned, and they despawn outside of it). if host leaves the area and they are killed by the client, stealth fails.
  if client enters the spawn area and host kills them, stealth fails. in other words, if you want to kill, make sure host spawns them first and keep the host inside the spawn area.
  to check on whatever the spawns are reacting to host/client, once the agent leaves the spawn area, sniper despawns. so the first sniper can be killed but if playing with 3 or 4 players, he could be spawned by client.
  Usually, snipers will shoot others who didn't spawn them and sometimes stealth fails when they take a shot at the host.
  also sometimes snipers shoot host for no reason even when the host spawned them first and stealth fails.
- When host/client steps below the staircase that leads to basement (warehouse, place below the disguise) or in halls in secret passage, snipers and enemies on the street that can fail stealth despawn and never respawn again until host/client goes back to the streets.
- Stun jacking snipers or enemies on the street doesn't fail stealth.
- Camera angle change at the end only occurs on the host's screen.

Lorelei:
- Intro music loops and never changes.
- Clients see all the levels in the elevator and "Level 13" as "Level 7".
- Trigger on Level 6 that makes workers as enemies can be untriggered whenever a player re-enters the elevator. This however only works for the host and workers are treated as friendly towards him. Workers are always enemies for clients.
- When disguise is taken, any non-taken out worker gets triggered and tries to sound alarm.
- Mujari shoots at clients only.
- Since checkpoints are triggered for both host and client, during defending nuke the mission can be softlocked since whoever died, respawns outside the place and doors are closed. Probably can still be circumvented using sarin/dormagen.
