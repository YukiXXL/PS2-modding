Final Release:
MemSlots + 0x94 = Load on death
MemSlots + 0x98 = Load when restarting

- check what writes to "(g_MissionLoad)+0x16"
- get s0
- change the challenge number from FFFFFFFF to unused number
- underneath and 0x4 to the right is something that needs to be zero'd out
- check what writes to challenge number and re-apply (lw at, 0x0(a1) -> a1 = address)

Debugging notes:
- each time player dies, the level decompiles (_fast_decomp_data)
- the memory saves to (MemSlots+0x98) which gets read and writes to other memory later

Prototype:
MemSlots + 0x90 = Load on death
MemSlots + 0x94 = Load when restarting
