Welcome to my repository where I will store cheat codes and modded save games or files for the games I like to waste my time on XD <br/>
Any contributers are welcome. :)

# Table of contents <br/>
### **Cheat Codes** (The name already tells) <br/>
### **PNACH_V2** (Codes for the new pnach system) <br/>
### **Save files** (Custom save files) <br/>
### **Tools** (Tools for modding purposes):
- **Cheat Engine Tables** (Tables for use with Cheat Engine)
- **PS2DIS** (Premade files with labels for use with PS2DIS)

# Converting cheats
Cheats here are made for PCSX2 emulator which uses RAW type. To convert it into RAW(Unencrypted) format, simply copy the address and value and add space inbetween: <br/>
<br/>
patch=1,EE,**ADDRESS**,extended,**VALUE** <br/>
### Example: <br/>
### ORIGINAL:<br/>
//Keep Online button <br/>
patch=1,EE,202A0624,extended,24030000 <br/>
### CONVERTED:<br/>
Keep Online button <br/>
202A0624 24030000 <br/>

## Other cheat devices
If you have other cheat devices like Codebreaker or Action Replay, use Omniconvert and **use the RAW type, not PCSX2 type of codes**.<br/>
You can get Omniconvert from here: https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1980.
